# Sven's Dotfiles
These dotfiles are inspired by:
- [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
- [Matt Gaunt's dotfiles](https://github.com/gauntface/dotfiles)

## Installation
These scripts should be Linux agnostic exlcuding the `setupSoftware` function in [setup.sh](./setup.sh). `setupSoftware` is written for [Fedora Workstation](http://getfedora.org).

To get started, run the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svenvNL/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh?$(date +%s)")
```
